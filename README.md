# Doctor Appointment Booking Website ü•º
A doctor appointment booking website build with mongodb, express, reactjs and nodejs.

# üí°About this project 
The Doctor Appointment Booking Website is a useful full-stack project divided into three parts: the backend, frontend, and an admin panel. Users can sign up, sign in, and access pages like Home, All Doctors, About, and Contact. On the All Doctors page, users can filter doctors by specialization. Selecting a doctor takes them to the doctor‚Äôs profile, where they can easily book an appointment by choosing a date. If they change their mind, they can cancel the appointment from their profile page.

The admin panel includes features to add doctor information, such as their name, graduation, specialization, and photo.

I completed this project in about three weeks, and it helped me learn a lot and improve my development skills.
